As a clinical psychologist turned sofrware engineer, I have always been passionate about the mental health field along with the most meaningful, evidence based and effective practices it has to offer. With the skills and tools I have gained in my journey as a developer, I was inspired to create a website that not only meets requirements and showcases my aquired skills, but which also provides a useful tool for mental health professionals and their clients. In my years of working in the feild I have felt a gap in communication between client and therapists: therapists only see what the client presents during a weekly one hour session, and clients often are too embarassed to be truthful and honest about their experiences. This can often prolong the amount of time needed for the therapist to provide useful and effective intervetions, and when talking about someone's mental health - very often every single week matters.  

More specifically, cognitive behavioral therapists often rely on clients filling out CBT journals in the time between their sessions, where they log their feelings, thoughts and emotions throughout the week. This information is invaluable to the therapist and is often vital to successful treatement. Having to once fill out one of these journals myself, I can confidently say that many times this assignment is skipped or done haphazardly due to the inconvenience of the task. Untange provides a convenient and quick way for clients to record their negative thought patterns on the go! Not only that - Untangle also provides a platform for therapists as well: mental health professionals can creare their own accounts and connect with their clients, seeing their new journal posts in real time! 

I trult believe Untangle can be the perfect solution to succesful and, most importantly, helpful therapeutic work between a client and their therapist. Feel free to take a peek inside!
